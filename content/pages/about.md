## Grow is almost certainly the best way for teams to build, launch, and organize websites, together.

Grow is a new rapid, collaborative, and social way to build and launch web sites. It works great for both teams and for individuals. It's simple and nimble, neither "cloud" nor "local", and neither "managed" nor "decentralized". The goal is to make Grow the best way to build web sites, now and years into the future.

It is under heavy development. The best way to learn more is to <a href="/blog/all-i-want-to-do-is-build-a-web-site/">read the introductory blog post</a> or to <a href="/public/datasheet.pdf">download the data sheet</a>.
